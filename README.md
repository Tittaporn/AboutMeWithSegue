# AboutMeWithSegue
It is an iOS app that shows details and info of people using tableViewController and Model data. The app allows users to select from a table of different people and see an about me page on each of them. The app utilize two different viewControllers with segue as a bridge between them. 

## What I have learned
I am able to select and pass data through a segue (a feature found in almost every iOS application). I am able to define these keywords : 
* TableView
* TableViewDataSource Methods
* Segue
* segue.Destination
* Model
* View
* ViewController
* Controller
* UINavigationController
